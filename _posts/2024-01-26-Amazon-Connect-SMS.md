title: Amazon Connect SMS - Enabling Two Way SMS
---

## Introduction ##

Welcome to another year of posts covering various AWS products and services. The content in these posts is driven by what I'm working or investigating for use with my clients. In November 2023, AWS announced that Amazon Connect now supports two-way Short Messaging Service (SMS).
Amazon Connect SMS uses the same configuration and agent experience as calls &  chats, making it easy to deliver an enhanced omnichannel customer experiences. Customers can request assistance by simply sending a text message or by responding to a proactive message initiated by an outbound campaign.

Amazon Connect SMS is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London).

## Enabling SMS in Amazon Connect ##

You will use Amazon Pinpoint SMS to obtain an SMS-enabled phone number and enable two-way SMS on the number. Finally we will import it into Amazon Connect.

* Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/] in the Frankfurt (EU-Central-1) region. You must claim Pinpoint number in the same region as your Amazon Connect instance.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Amazon-Connect-SMS/BlogImage1.png)

* In the navigation pane, under Configurations, choose Phone numbers and then Request originator.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Amazon-Connect-SMS/BlogImage2.png)

* On the Select country page you must choose the Message destination country from the drop down that messages will be sent to. Choose Next. We going to select Ireland for this exercise

* On the Messaging use case section, enter the following and then click Next.

- Under Number capabilities choose SMS.

- Under Estimated monthly SMS message volume per month â€“ Select < 5,000

- For Company headquarters, select Local

- For Two-way messaging select Yes

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Amazon-Connect-SMS/BlogImage4.png)

* Under Select originator type, choose Long Code and click Next. To request a long code you need to open a case with AWS Support. I'm not going to cover the opening of the Support Case. It took 10 days for AWS to receive an Irish mobile number to assign to me in Pinpoint.

## Amazon Connect SMS Call Flow ##

* In my Amazon Connect I have created a new simple Call flow called SMS.

* You need to add a Check contact attributes block to the flow.

- Namespace value is Segment attributes
- Key has a value of subscriptionType
- Condition is Equals
- Value must be connect:SMS

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Amazon-Connect-SMS/BlogImage13.png)

* Also included in my flow is Set Working Queue and Transfer to flow. Please see my earlier blog posts if you need assistance on creating a call flow.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Amazon-Connect-SMS/BlogImage14.png)

* Final step is to associate the phone number with the call flow. In Amazon Connect go to Channels, Phone numbers and associate the number to the call flow created in Step 1.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Amazon-Connect-SMS/BlogImage15.png)

## Testing Two-Way SMS ##

We are now ready to test two-way SMS. For this we will need the Amazon Connect Agent Workspace or Contact Control Panel (CCP) and a mobile phone.

* In the Agent Workspace set yourself to available

* Using a mobile device, send a SMS to the phone number created in Pinpoint.

* The Agent Workspace will ring with a SMS chat.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Amazon-Connect-SMS/BlogImage16.png)

* The agent and customer communicate as normal over SMS.

**N.B**
Please note to release the phone number claimed if you no longer need it as there is a monthly charge of **$10**.
